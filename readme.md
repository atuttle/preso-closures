## Running this presentation

Because of the way the presentation assets are setup, you can not just double-click index.html and go.

You need to either:

* run an in-directory web server like [NWS](https://npmjs.org/package/nws), or
* clone the repo into an existing website (e.g. localhost)

Essentially: `file:///` = bad, `http://` = good. If you do that, you'll be fine.

### Speaker Notes

Once you've got the presentation running in your browser, hit the `S` key to bring up the speaker notes (if you want them).
